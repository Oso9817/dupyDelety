## About The Project

Do you ever find yourself working with non-unique filesets? Try DupyDelety!

Here's why:

* Saves substantial time not checking duplicates by hand
* JPG/PNG capable! Skips other files
* Perfect for removing duplicates before sharing content!

I was working with a large dataset, archiving an entire discord servers attached files sent in chat. After realizing its not uncommon for a file or image to be sent multiple times by users. I realized there needs to be a valid way to check for duplicates to save on storage space as well as time, making this process more efficient than not checking or doing so by hand.

## Built With
